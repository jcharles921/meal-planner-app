# Meal Planner Web Application

### Problem:
Planning meals for the week can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for busy individuals or families. Many people struggle to create balanced and varied meal plans, leading to repetitive meals or unhealthy food choices. Additionally, compiling a shopping list for the planned meals is often a hassle, resulting in missed ingredients or multiple grocery trips.

### Solution:
Develop a web-based Meal Planner application that allows users to plan meals for the week, view a calendar of their meal plans, and automatically generate a shopping list based on selected meals. The app aims to simplify meal planning, promote healthier food choices, and reduce the time spent on organizing meals and grocery lists.

#### Key Features:
- **Meal Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of meals organized by type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).
- **Weekly Calendar View**: A visual weekly calendar to organize and display the chosen meals.
- **Auto-generated Shopping List**: Creates a comprehensive shopping list with ingredients based on the planned meals.
- **Simple Authentication** (Optional): Allows users to save their meal plans and return to them later.
