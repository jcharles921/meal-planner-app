# Meal Planner Web App

### Problem Statement  
Planning weekly meals is a common challenge for busy individuals and families. The lack of time, variety, and proper planning leads to repetitive meals, missed ingredients, or unhealthy food choices. Compiling a shopping list based on planned meals further adds to the complexity, often resulting in inefficiencies or multiple trips to the store.

### Objective  
To develop a web-based Meal Planner application that simplifies meal planning by allowing users to select meals, organize them on a weekly calendar, and generate a comprehensive shopping list. The application aims to:  
- Streamline meal organization.  
- Promote healthier food choices.  
- Save time in planning and shopping.

   - Exportable in PDF or text format.  

4. **User Authentication (Optional)**:
